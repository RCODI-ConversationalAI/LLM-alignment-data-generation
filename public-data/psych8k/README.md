### ChatPsychiatrist (a.k.a. Psych8k) (Liu et al., 2023)

**Overview**: The ChatPsychiatrist dataset (Psych8k) was derived from 260 real-life counseling recordings provided by accredited professionals with extensive counseling experience. It focuses on prevalent mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression, as well as stress, relationships, and issues affecting minority groups, including LGBTQ and culturally diverse individuals. These counseling recordings were transcribed into textual data and processed for research purposes.

- **Query-Answer Generation**: GPT-4 was employed to distill query-answer pairs from the transcribed conversations. Each short conversation clip (spanning ten rounds of dialogue) was used as context for GPT-4, which generated corresponding query-answer pairs.

**Topics and Contributions**:

- Covers diverse topics, including emotion, family, relationships, career development, academic stress, and more.
- Emphasizes issues pertinent to minority groups, such as LGBTQ individuals and people from varied cultural backgrounds.
- Includes 8,187 query-answer pairs, totaling 2 million tokens, making it a substantial resource for mental health-related AI research.

**Data Format**: The dataset consists of query-answer pairs extracted from real counseling transcripts. Each entry includes:

1. **Context**: A short conversation clip spanning ten rounds.
2. **Query**: Generated by GPT-4 based on the context.
3. **Answer**: Generated by GPT-4 in response to the query.

**Stats**: 8,187 query-answer pairs and 2 million tokens derived from ~260 counseling conversations.
